# Hi! I am Muskan. Welcome to my minimalist blog.

You must be wondering why such a boring blog!

Images, patterns and colors become overwhelming to me sometimes as there are endless possibilities. Also, they often take over the attention from the content that is to be conveyed. Ironically, I am a frontend-dev and I deal with a lot of UI-UX formatting in my day-to-day work, and this blog is perhaps my escape from thinking.

So here is my boring blog, with just words and some basic formatting. I want to highlight the important stuff here about me. This blog is a reflection of what I am and what I want to be. As I support minimalist living, why should my blog have all the clutter!
