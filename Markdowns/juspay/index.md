## My Experience at Juspay

#### About

Juspay is a payments company processing 4 million transaction per day, with net payment hits more that 4.1 billion. People here love functional programming and emphasize on writing code like a mathematical formula. Their tech stack reflect their philosophy with backend mostly written in Haskell and frontend framework written in purescript. 

I have had a chance to mostly work on their frontend products and the in-house framework which is platform agnostic. Our goal is to develop a single SDK across platforms for 100+ merchants, supporting their individual UI requirements as well as their business needs (supporting various payment instruments, using native APIs for enhanced UX etc.)
